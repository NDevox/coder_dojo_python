# Coder Dojo Projects

Our team of mentors have the idea of introducing long-term collaborative projects to Coder Dojo.

This would give a chance for those kids who are more motivated to create applications which solve real world problems.

In the process we hope they will learn more about the development experience and become more confident coders.

## General things to learn

* Team Collaboration on a project.

* VCS and its importance (git).

* How different tech interact with each other (e.g. Python/ruby and HTML for web projects).
