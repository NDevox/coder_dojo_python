This is an initial basic idea involving a web project.

## Idea

A web page which displays messages people have written on it.

## Requirements

* A web page to display and write messages.

* A database to store the messages.

* A backend which can retrieve messages from the database, and add messages to the database.

## Stretch goals

* User authentication (allow private messaging and unique usernames as well as anonymous posting.

* Multiple message threads - Relating messages to threads of conversation.

## Specifics to learn

* HTML/css - How the website looks (A single web page should be simple).

* HTTP - How we ask for data on webpages (only need to touch on this).

* Data Models - How we see data in a program (Major stepping stone).

* ORMs - How we interact with data (Major stepping stone - only need a surface level view).

* Data Views - How we pass data to be displayed on our HTML.

* Web frameworks to encompass the above - Django/Flask/Rails - up for discussion.
