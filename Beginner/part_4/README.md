# Beginner Python - Part 4

Welcome to your fifth python lesson!

We're learning more about "control flow" in this lesson.

## Loops

In the last lesson we mentioned loops, in this lesson we will use one.

There are two types of loops:

1) `for` loops.
2) `while` loops.

In this lesson we are using a `while` loop.

### What is a `while` loop?

A `while` loop is a loop which keeps doing the same thing over and over
until a condition is not met.

For example:

```python
num = 1
while num < 10:
    print(num)
    num = num + 1
```

This creates a variable called `num`. It then creates a `while` loop
which checks to see if `num` is smaller then 10. If it is it will 
execute everything indented after the `while` statement.

Here we print `num` and then increase it by 1. Eventually `num` will 
be 10 or greater, at this point the `while` loop will break and the 
program will end.

## The lesson

We are going to randomly generate a number and ask a user to guess it.

We will use a `while` loop to keep asking them until they get the number 
right and we'll use an `if` statement to give them a hint to get closer.

Let's open a new file and get started.

### Part 1 - generate a random number.

We need to import the `random` library and get a random number.

Put this at the top of the file:

```python
import random

target = random.randint(1, 1000)
```

This will give us a variable `target` which holds a random number 
between 1 and 1000. You can change this to any set of numbers you want.

### Part 2 - ask the user for a guess

Like we did when getting the users age, lets ask them to guess a number.

Add the following to the file:

```python
guess = int(input('Guess a number between 1 and 1000: '))
```

We are now storing the guess in a variable called `guess`

### Part 3 - write the loop

Now we need to write the loop.

We are going to keep going until `guess` is equal to `target`. This means
while `guess` is not equal to `target` we should stay in the loop.

We use `!=` to test if something is not equal (`==` is what we use to
test if something _is_ equal).

When in the loop we will check to see if `guess` is bigger or smaller
than `target` and let the user know.

Once they guess correctly we exit the loop and `print` another message

Add the following to your file:

```python
while guess != target:
    if guess < target:
        guess = int(input('That is too low! Try again: '))
    elif guess > target:
        guess = int(input('That is too high! Try again: '))

print('Yes! That is the number!')

```

And that is it!
